# AI-ML-DL_Checklist
I know AI since 2018 but I never deep dive into it. That's why today I still don't know how to implement all models. The repository is about all topics I remember in my mind. I would like to work on them



## How I remember different parts of AI and I have no clue:

- [ ] RL                        (Deep Q algorithm)
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] KNN
- [ ] NLP                       (sentiment analysis, text recognition speech recognition)
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] GANs
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] RCNN
- [ ] RELU
- [ ] Argmax
- [ ] Deep dream
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Time series
- [ ] Bayes theorem
- [ ] Classification
- [ ] K-means cluster
- [ ] Computer vision
- [ ] Back propagation
- [ ] Gradient descent
- [ ] Nearest Neighbor
- [ ] Object detection
- [ ] Anomaly detection
- [ ] Genetic Algorithm
- [ ] Dimensionality reduction
